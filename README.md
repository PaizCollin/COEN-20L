COEN 20: Embedded Systems

Santa Clara University, Dr. Dan Lewis, Spring 2021

This includes various Assembly Language projects from the lab section of this course. C files were provided by the professor. All labs are tested on an STM32F429 Discovery Board.

Lab 1A - 16-Bit Calculator (Intro): Installing GNU, building the output files, and testing the board

Lab 2A - 8-Bit Binary Numbers (Signed/Unsigned Bits): Create C functions to demonstrate your understanding of signed and unsigned 8-bit binary Numbers. Includes converting bits to its signed decimal value, bits to its unsigned decimal value, an unsigned decimal value to bits, and incrementing through an 8-bit value

Lab 3A - Functions & Parameters (Functions/Parameters): Implement functions to add two values together, subtract a value by 1, square a value, and return the sum of a value + the square root of that value

Lab 4C - Optimization (Address Alignment/Data Dependency): Run through the program and note the execution times and cycles/instruction for each of the functions. Analyze why they are different

Lab 5E - Disk Drive Geometry (Arithmetic): Implement a function that locates a logical block address based on the entered values for the total number of cylinders, heads, and sectors

Lab 6C - Sliding 15-Puzzle (If Statements): Implement functions 'CopyCell' and 'FillCell' to copy and fill cells of a 4x4 grid to solve a picture puzzle

Lab 7C - Autonomous Sudoku (Bit Manipulation): Implement functions 'GetNibble' and 'PutNibble' to recursively solve the sudoku puzzle. The use of loops is prohibited; must use shifting, bitwise, and bitfield instructions

Lab 8A - Zeller's Rule (Reciprocal Multiplication/Replacing Multiplication): Implement 3 different Zeller functions. Zeller1 allows the use of any multiply or division instructions. Zeller2 prohibits the use of division instructions (UDIV, SDIV). Zeller3 prohibits the use of multiply instructions (MUL, MLS, etc.). Note the cycle count for each function on the board's screen.

Lab 9B - Gabriel's Horn (Floating-Point Instructions): Implement a function that uses floating-point arithmetic to perform the calculation for Gabriel's Horn

Lab 11E - Q16 Square Root (Q16 Fixed-Point Arithmetic): Implement a function that uses Q16 fixed-point arithmetic to compute the square root of the value. Compare the precision of each output
